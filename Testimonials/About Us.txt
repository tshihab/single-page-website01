-> About us Section

‘BakedCake’ is one of only a handful few enduring Craft Bakeries in Surrey. We have assembled our notoriety on consolidating great quality conventional heating with a great incentive for cash.

We offer our clients a full scope of bread, forte bread, morning merchandise, cakes, and baked goods.

Our bread is heated day by day at our pastry shop in East Horsley and is conveyed to our twelve shops. We utilize profoundly gifted specialty dough punchers to guarantee each portion of bread is flawless without fail.

Our pastry specialists work during that time with the goal that the portion of bread you purchase toward the beginning of the day is crisp out of the stove!
